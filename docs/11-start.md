# Start

Now that we have covered all the basics of Rust, Blockchain, and Runtime Development, it is time to get started coding!

Make sure you have [setup](setup.md) your `substrate-node-template` with the **Empty Pallet Template** to begin this workshop.

Each section will have some information about what we are doing, and some steps to follow to add new code snippets to your custom pallet.

At the end of each page, you should have code which compiles successfully with:

```bash
cargo build -p pallet-template
```

Compiler warnings are OK.

If you have any questions, please let us know and take advantage of the [notes section](notes.md) to share any text easily with others.
